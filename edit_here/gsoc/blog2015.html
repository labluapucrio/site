Port Lua Test Suite to NetBSD Kernel</a></h3>

Lourival Vieira Neto
<p>
The Lua interpreter was initially ported to the 
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> kernel during GSoC 2010,
allowing users to <a href="http://netbsd.org/~lneto/dls14.pdf">write kernel extensions using Lua scripts</a>.
During GSoC 2015, Guilherme worked on porting the 
<a href="http://www.lua.org/tests/">Lua test suite</a> 
to the NetBSD kernel. He adapted test scripts to
eliminate dependencies on floating-point numbers and the operating
system itself.
</p>

<p>
Guilherme also ported and reimplemented part of the
Lua standard libraries (e.g., math and io) for satisfying test
dependencies. Moreover, he found important bugs on the Lua kernel
port (which is the ultimate purpose of testing software ;-)).

Elasticsearch Lua client (elasticsearch-lua)</a></h3>

<p>
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> is a distributed and scalable search engine written in Java that,
besides its native transport protocol (Java to Java), offers a very complete REST API 
accessed through JSON. 
Dhaval built <a href="https://github.com/DhavalKapil/elasticsearch-lua">elasticsearch-lua</a>, an initial client for the Lua language following a model 
similar to other existing clients, such as the clients written in Python 
and PHP.
</p>
<p>
Dhaval had freedom to decide how to model the object oriented API
and how to build tests during development. 
With elasticsearch-lua, programmers can now access most Elasticsearch
functionalities, such as index, read, update, delete, and search documents.
</p>

<p>
The elasticsearch-lua client does proper load balancing across all nodes with 
pluggable and multiple selection strategies, implements a connection pool 
and offers the reindex feature (not available in Elasticsearch).

Port an SDL-based C++ open source game to Céu</a></h3>
<h4 id="student">Student</h4>
Alexander Tkachev -  Novosibirsk State Universit, Russia.
<h4 id="mentor">Mentor</h4>
Francisco Sant'Anna
<p>
<a href="http://ceu-lang.org/">Céu</a> is a programming language that
targets the development of reactive applications such as video games.
It features first-class support for events and parallel compositions for lines
of execution.
For this project, we wanted to port an open source game of considerable size from 
C++ to Céu.
</p>

<p>
Alexander chose the game <a href="http://pingus.seul.org">Pingus</a> (a Lemmings-like
game for Linux) with a codebase of around 40k lines of code.
An important requirement of our project was to do a "live port" of the game,
in which the game remained fully functional while portions of
it were ported to Céu and the rest remained in C++.
</p>

<p>
In this project, Alexander faced two main challenges:
applying the Céu idioms to the new code and
keeping the old C++ code working across the language boundaries.
Even though the code base was too big for a 3-month period,
Alexander was able to port around half of the game, including its core
(i.e., the game levels).

Add support for WSDL generation to LuaSOAP</a></h3>

Tomás Guisasola

<p>
<a href="http://tomasguisasola.github.io/luasoap">LuaSOAP</a>
is a library to ease the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>,
the Simple Object Access Protocol. It provides a very simple 
API that converts Lua tables to and from XML documents. 
It offers two modules to help providing (server) and consuming (client) 
SOAP services.
</p>

<p>
Victor developed a module to help the generation of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a>
(Web Services Description Language) documents for the services implemented by the server.
This new module traverses the service description (a Lua table, 
built by the programmer by hand, because Lua doesn't have this kind 
of information) and produces the WSDL description for it.
This new module will be integrated into LuaSOAP next version.

Design of TIER encoding and its implementation in Lua</a></h3>
<h4 id="student">Student</h4>
Lukas Borin - Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.
<h4 id="mentor">Mentor</h4>
Renato Maia

<p>
TIER is an experimental language-independent binary encoding format,
designed by this project's mentor, similar in purpose to formats like XML,
JSON and Google's Protocol Buffers. TIER is designed to optionally support
self-describing encodings that include meta-information about the serial
structure of the encoded data; this meta-information can be used to support
dynamic verifications or automatic decoding.
</p>
<p>
Lukas improved TIER's design and also wrote the first implementation of a 
Lua library that provides support for TIER encodings. 
He also wrote TIER's basic documentation and some tutorials on its usage. 
The TIER library supports custom mappings of the various TIER serial 
structures to specific Lua values. On top of this custom mapping support, 
Lukas also developed some predefined mappings for usual Lua values and a 
framework to facilitate the creation of mappings for usual Lua structures, 
such as sequences, maps, sets, etc.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Lukas also developed a 
collection of mappings to automatically translate Lua values into TIER 
encodings and vice-versa, using different approaches 
to preserve structure of the original Lua value in the encoded stream.

Improvements to the Sailor Web Framework</a></h3>

<p>
<a href="http://sailorproject.org/">Sailor</a> is an MVC web framework for Lua. Its distinguishing
feature is that it easily lets the programmer
write Lua code for running both in the server and in the
browser. It was created by Etiene Dalcol, and she submitted
a project proposal to us with a series of planned improvements.
</p>
<p>
During GSoC 2015, she worked on three fronts for improving
the framework: the first was a better test suite, the second
was better documentation for the project, and the third was
a series of improvements for the feature of running Lua code
on the browser, with the possibility of having Lua code in
the browser request new modules on demand from the server,
and breaking the original dependency on also having node.js
installed on the server.
</p>
<p>
All of the GSoC contributions are already committed to the
<a href="https://github.com/Etiene/sailor">
Sailor project repository at Github</a>,
and the test suite is already part of Sailor 0.4, the latest
public release of the project.
