<h2>LabLua in Google Summer of Code 2020</h2>

<p>We were very happy to participate again in Google Summer of Code (GSoC)!
This is the seventh time we had the opportunity to collaborate with students from all around the world on interesting projects.
These are the highlights from the 2020 edition, in the student's own words.

<h2 id="caribay">A Parser Generator with Automatic Error Recovery for LPeg(Label) — Gustavo Castellanos</h2>
<!--<img class="photo-right" src="/images/gsoc2020/Gustavo.jpg" alt="A picture of Gustavo"/>-->
<p>For this project we created Caribay, a PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) parser generator
built with <a href="https://github.com/sqmedeiros/lpeglabel/">LpegLabel</a>,
with support of automatic generation of error labels and error recovery rules.
The generated parser produces a generic abstract syntax tree or a list of thrown errors.
Caribay makes easier to parse lexical symbols, comments, identifiers and keywords using its own syntax.

<p>We developed a parser for the input grammar,
a preprocessor for computing FIRST and FOLLOW sets, 
an algorithm for automatically generating error labels,
optional optimizations which can be enabled by the user, 
and a translator that generates LPegLabel patterns.

<p>A story about the name: Caribay is the daughter of Zuhé (the Sun) and Chía (the Moon)
from a legend of the Mirripuyes (an indigenous group from Mérida, Venezuela).
Since Lua means Moon in Portuguese, the tool being the daughter of Lua sounded nice to me.
Also, the legend involves the origin of five famous peaks from Mérida, so the name is related to "generating" things.

<h3>The Code</h3>
Caribay can be installed using <a href="https://luarocks.org/">Luarocks</a>.
The source code has been published <a href="https://github.com/gustavoaca1997/Caribay">on Github</a>.

<h3>The Student</h3>

<h2 id="lunatik">Lua states management for Lunatik — Matheus Silva Rodrigues</h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="/images/gsoc2020/Matheus.jpg" alt="A picture of Matheus"/>
<p>In this project we added support for the Lunatik framework to manage Lua execution states inside the kernel.
For this, we developed a kernel API that allows Lunatik bindings to create and
access Lua execution states handling the synchronization with user space or other bindings.
This includes a protocol over generic Netlink that allows creating and managing Lua states and Lua scripts from user space.
We also also adapted both NFLua and XDPLua to use these facilities.
More information can be found <a href="https://matheusntg.github.io/lunatik-states-managment/">in this link</a>.

<h3>The Code</h3>
The code created during this GSOC project will be merged into the related upstream projects.
There are three pull requests,
one for <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/pull/20">Lunatik</a>,
one for <a href=https://github.com/luainkernel/linux/pull/9>XDPLua</a>,
and one for <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/nflua/pull/1">NFLua</a>.

<h2 id="pallene">Pallene to Lua Translator — Samuel Rowe</h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="/images/gsoc2020/Samuel.jpg" alt="A picture of Samuel"/>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a> is a statically typed,
ahead-of-time-compiled sister language to Lua, with a focus on performance.
Programmers can use Pallene instead of C modules to improve the performance of their programs.
Pallene achieves this by translating a statically typed compilation unit into a C source file,
which is implicitly compiled in the background.
In this project, we implemented several new Pallene features, including the dot notation for the built-in modules,
the export keyword, and a Pallene to Lua translator (the new Lua backend).
The documentation and unit tests for the same were also written.

<p>We encountered many interesting challenges during the development.
One of them is that when we were testing the validity of the translator
we had to test both how the generated output looked and how it behaved at runtime.
For the latter case, we managed to come up with an elegant design that allowed us to reuse existing unit tests.
Thus, we were able to ensure that both the Lua and the C backends produce similar runtime behavior.

<p> Google Summer of Code has been an amazing experience!
I am really grateful to everyone at LabLua for providing me with this opportunity.
I learned about collaborating with others, keeping up with schedules, code reviews, rebasing Git branches,
writing unit tests with good coverage, and much more.
