<h2>LabLua in Google Summer of Code 2019</h2>

<p>
We are very happy to participate again in Google Summer of Code
(GSoC): this is our sixth year!
<p>
Here is, in their own words, a brief highlight of the students that are 
collaborating with us this year and the projects they are working on:

<h2>C Header File Parser in Lua Using Clang AST - Vishnu Murali (India)</h2>

<h3>About the project</h3>
&quot;<a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~hgualandi/papers/Gualandi-2018-SBLP.pdf" target="_blank">Pallene</a>,
the statically-typed companion language for Lua requires a Foreign
Function Interface(FFI) to C. This project aims at creating a Lua library that 
can parse C header files so as to represent C declarations in Lua.&quot;

<h3>About Vishnu</h3>
&quot;I’m Vishnu -  a coder-geek, mesmerized by the limitless horizons of the programming world and fortified by a passionate outlook for things. 
<p>I hail from Kerala, India and am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Government Engineering College, Thrissur.&quot;

<h2>Apolo: a Library to aid the Creation of Scripts in Lua - Connor McPherson (USA)</h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2019/Connor.JPG"/>
<h3>About the project</h3>
&quot;The project's goal is to add Bash Script functionality to the existing 
Lua interface. This allows Lua to function as a viable replacement for perl 
and bash as a scripting language while keeping the approachable and simplistic
nature that makes Lua so easy work with.&quot;

<h3>About Connor</h3>
&quot;I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga. 
Chattanooga is a vibrant startup city, with a thriving Innovation 
District and a lot of smart people.&quot;

<h2>XDPLua - Victor Nogueira (Brazil) </h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2019/Victor.jpg"/>

<h3>About the project</h3>
&quot;This project aims to introduce Lua to the XDP(eXpress Data Path) environment, allowing users to execute Lua scripts inside the XDP hooks. In this project we also run benchmarks to see how Lua performs in this environment
and compare it with the results of eBPF.&quot;

<h3>About Victor</h3>
&quot;I am from Brazil and I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science at PUC-Rio. My fields of interest in computer science are free software and operating systems.&quot;
<h3>Mentors</h3>
Lourival Vieira Neto and Pedro Tammela

<h2>Low-Power Interrupt-Based Drivers in C&eacute;u-Arduino - Jingrui Li (China)</h2>
<img class="photo-left" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2019/Jingrui.jpg"/>

<h3>About the project: </h3>
&quot;This project is about a new rising language, Céu (meaning sky in English),
which is created for embedded concurrent programming and is easy to use.
I am using this language to develop interrupt-based drivers for Arduino and 
its compatible devices.&quot;

<h3>About Jingrui Li</h3>
&quot;I am Jingrui, a junior from Northeastern University in China, majoring in
software engineering. I love computer science and like to develop anything 
interesting.&quot;

<h2>Google Cloud IoT Core Interface in Lua - Gaurav Kumar (India)</h2>
<img class="photo-left" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2019/Gaurav_Kumar.jpg"/>

<h3>About the project</h3>
&quot;The project involves developing an interface in 
Lua for the set of Google Cloud IoT Core APIs, through two REST resources:
<em>cloudiot</em> methods, to facilitate device manager tasks, and
<em>cloudiotdevice</em> methods, to facilitate device communication over the HTTP bridge.
I worked upon providing a Proof of Concept for the above mentioned interface using a real world embedded device like NodeMCU.&quot;

<h3>About Gaurav</h3>
<p>
&quot;I'm currently studying at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi 
(Himachal Pradesh). The thought of connecting people and machines together 
via Human-machine interaction is what I inspires me a lot.
I'm a keen enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things.
