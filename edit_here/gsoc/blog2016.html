<h2>Google Summer of Code 2016 Wrap Up</h2>

<p>
We were very happy to participate again in Google Summer of Code
(GSoC), our third year, and specially to have been able to mentor 
eight fine students that successfully completed their projects.
We thank them, and Google, for this
contribution to our R&D work.
<p>
Here is a brief highlight of this year's projects:

<b>Next Generation of the LuaRocks test suite - Robert Karasek</b>
</p>

<p>
<img class="photo-left" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/robert_karasek.jpg"   />
<a href="http://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a> is the package manager for
Lua modules. Its test suite was implemented as a big shell script that
performed only black-box testing and ran only on Linux. The goal for
this GSoC project was to port the test suite to Lua, improving its
portability and allowing more types of tests so we could raise our
coverage numbers.
<p>
Robert ported the test suite to Lua using 
<a href="https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/busted">Busted</a>,
a Lua unit testing tool. His efforts improved not only our coverage, but most
importantly, the portability of our tests: his new test suite, now
merged into mainline LuaRocks, runs under continuous integration on
both <a href="https://travis-ci.org/luarocks/luarocks">Linux,
macOS</a> and <a
href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hishamhm/luarocks/">Windows</a>.
This was an extremely welcome addition, bringing much greater
confidence to LuaRocks developers on avoiding portability regressions.
Robert improved the checks in existing tests and wrote many new ones,
including a new mock-server for testing the client API for uploading
packages to the <a href="http://luarocks.org">luarocks.org</a>
repository.

<b>Typed Lua Typechecker - Tomasz Dyczek</b>
</p>

<p>
<img class="photo-right" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/tomasz.jpg" 0 />
<a href="https://github.com/andremm/typedlua">Typed Lua</a>
is an optional type system that provides static type checking for
the Lua language.
Typed Lua extends the syntax of Lua 5.3 to introduce
optional type annotations, and performs local type inference
to detect more precise types for unannotated expressions.
</p>

<p>
During GSoC 2016, Tomasz implemented the
<a href="https://github.com/tomkee/typed-lua-core">
core of Typed Lua in Haskell</a>.
Tomasz's implementation parses code written in a syntax close to
the abstract syntax of Typed Lua and then type checks the 
generated AST. Besides providing a great support for testing
and reasoning about new features before introducing them to
Typed Lua, Tomasz's Haskell typechecker can be also used to validate
tests to be included in Typed Lua's test suite.

<b>Classes and Generics for Typed Lua - 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinclancy/">Kevin Clancy</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<img class="photo-left" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/KevinClancy.jpg" />
During GSoC 2016, Kevin worked on the implementation of
a class system for <a href="https://github.com/andremm/typedlua">Typed Lua</a>.
He also added parametric polymorphism
(generics) to Typed Lua, not only for classes, but also for
existing Typed Lua types such as its functions and tables.
<p>
Kevin's work currently lives in its
<a href="https://github.com/kevinclancy/typedlua">own branch</a>,
but will me merged in the main branch ASAP.
Meanwhile, Kevin has written a 
<a href="http://kevinclancy.github.io/2016/08/18/a-class-system-for-typed-lua.html">
detailed post</a> explaining all the features that have been implemented

<b>Improving Error Reporting in PEG Parsers - Matthew Allen Go</b>
</p>
<p>
<img class="photo-right" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/matthew.jpg"   />
<a href="https://github.com/sqmedeiros/lpeglabel/">LPegLabel</a> is an extension
of <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/">LPeg</a>,
a pattern matching tool for Lua, based on 
<a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/peg">Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)</a>.
LPegLabel supports labeled failures, a facility that improves error
reporting and recovery for PEG-based parsers.
<p>
The goal of this project was to use LPegLabel to write parsers
with good error reporting. These parsers could then be used by
the Lua community and also serve as a guide for LPegLabel users.
Because LPegLabel is a young tool, another important
expected contribution was to improve the tool's usability.
<p>
Matthew achieved both goals during GSoC 2016.
First, he developed a 
<a href="https://github.com/undecidabot/lua-parser/">
Lua parser for Lua 5.3</a> based on LPegLabel.
After GSoC 2016, Matthew's work has been incorporated into
the new release of
<a href="https://github.com/andremm/lua-parser">lua-parser</a>
(1.0.0), which is already available to the Lua community.
<p>
Matthew also contributed to LPegLabel's
usability by improving its API and documentation.

<b>Improving elasticsearch-lua tests and build -
<a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/">Dhaval Kapil</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<img class="photo-left" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/dhaval.jpg"   />
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>
is a distributed and scalable search engine written in Java that, 
besides the transport protocol (Java to Java), offers a REST API accessed through JSON.
During GSoC 2015, Dhaval implemented 
<a href="https://github.com/DhavalKapil/elasticsearch-lua">elasticsearch-lua</a>,
an initial client for the Lua language following a model similar to other 
existing clients, such as the clients written in Python and PHP.
<p>
During GSoC 2016, Dhaval worked on improving elasticsearch-lua.
Apart from adding a test suite to elasticsearch-lua and making it robust, 
he also documented the entire codebase and updated the current client to be 
compatible with a newer version of Elasticsearch. 
<p>
Dhaval exceeded our expectations by also creating a new library called 
<a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Lua-Version-Manager">luaver</a>.
This work was motivated by having to frequently switch between different 
versions of Lua while developing the test suite.
<p>A full blog post about Dhaval's project during GSoC 2016 can be found
<a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Elasticsearch-Lua-GSOC-2016/">here</a>.

<b>Admin Center and Elasticsearch integration for Sailor - 
<a href="https://github.com/rnikhil275">Nikhil Ramesh</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<img class="photo-right" src="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/images/gsoc2016/nikhil.jpg"   />
<a href="http://sailorproject.org/">Sailor</a> is a web framework written 
in the Lua programming language and structured in a model-view-controller 
(MVC) architecture. Like other web development frameworks, such as Ruby on 
Rails and Django, it is designed to make the development process faster by 
making some assumptions and conventions (over configuration) and 
encouraging principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
<p>
During GSoC 2016, Nikhil Ramesh focused on extending the Sailor framework 
by adding new features to it.
The first feature he worked on was an Admin Center, which is 
initially being used as a web interface for editing the configuration 
of an application and accessing auto generation of scaffolding pages.
Another part of his work consisted of integrating Sailor and 
elasticsearch-lua to facilitate Elasticsearch indexes to be stored as 
Sailor Models.
<p> 
Nikhil's work is currently pending as a 
<a href="https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor/pull/125">Pull Request</a>,
to be merged as soon as possible.

<b>Extending the online tutorial of C&eacute;u with Emscripten and SDL - Margarit Vicentiu</b>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://ceu-lang.org/">C&eacute;u</a>
is a programming language that targets the development of reactive applications 
such as video games and embedded systems. Its compiler generates output in plain C 
to integrate easily with the the underlying platform (e.g. Arduino, SDL).
For this project, we wanted to integrate C&eacute;u with 
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/">Emscripten</a>
to also run applications in a web browser.
<p>
Vicentiu started with the online tutorial of C&eacute;u, which is a server-side application:
the user types C&eacute;u code in a text area and hits the send button;
the server receives the code, executes it, and sends the output back to the user.
During the summer, Vicentiu made most of the examples compile with Emscripten and 
run in real-time in the user screen.
<p>
Our next goal is to make the graphical examples with user interactions also work in 
the browser, and Vicentiu plans to continue contributing to the project to 
achieve this goal.

<b>An automatic generator of WSDL documents for LuaSOAP - Victor Dias</b>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://tomasguisasola.github.io/luasoap">LuaSOAP</a>
is a library to ease the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>,
the Simple Object Access Protocol.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a> 
is an XML format for describing
network services; it is used to describe operations, messages and types
offered by Web Services.
</p>

<p>
This summer Victor extended LuaSOAP's support of WSDL
by developing a software layer that helps automatic generation of WSDL documents.
This new layer eases the description of most WSDL &quot;bureaucracy&quot; 
(types, operations, ports, messages...) with no counterpart in a dynamic language 
like Lua.
He also improved the test suite and the documentation.
<p>

<a href="https://github.com/DiasVictor/luasoap">Victor's work</a>
will be integrated into LuaSOAP's next version.
</p>
