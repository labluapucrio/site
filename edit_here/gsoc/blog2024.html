<h2>LabLua in Google Summer of Code 2024</h2>

<p>We were very happy to participate again in Google Summer of Code (GSoC)!
This is the 9th time we had the opportunity to collaborate with students from all around the world on interesting projects.
These are the highlights from the 2024 edition.

<h2 id="pallene">Improved debugging support for Pallene</h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="/images/gsoc2024/asif.jpg" alt="A picture of Asif"/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a> is type
inferred, ahead-of-time compiled companion language to Lua designed for performance.
This is a space currently filled by LuaJIT and Lua C modules.
Pallenes syntax is similar to Lua's allowing users to write
high-performance code swiftly.</p>

<p>Pallene's debugging experience was hampered by how Lua stack traces
display C stack frames, because Pallene compiles down to C. The Lua
call stack does not store the line numbers for Lua-to-C calls and does
not show C-to-C calls. To address the problem not only for Pallene
but also for Lua C modules in general, we created a new library, <a
href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene-tracer">Pallene Tracer</a>.
It provides mechanisms to enable function tracebacks, generating a proper
stack-trace for all the C call-frames and their respective line numbers,
without modifying the Lua virtual machine. Hence, over the summer time we
worked on Pallene Tracer, its adoption in Pallene and finally its adoption
into Lua C modules. You can learn more about this journey in <a
href="https://singul4ri7y.github.io/gsoc2024">Asif's blog</a>.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>For this project we created a <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene-tracer">Github repository for pallene-tracer</a>.
We also created pull requests code to
<a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Asingul4ri7y+created%3A%3E2024-05-27+merged%3A%3C2024-08-20">integrate Pallene with Pallene Tracer</a>.

<h2 id="luarocks">Port LuaRocks to Teal</h2>
<img class="photo-right" src="/images/gsoc2024/victor.jpeg" alt="A picture of Victor"/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks">Luarocks</a>
is a package manager for the Lua programming language.
It allows developers to install, manage, and distribute Lua packages,
which are collections of Lua modules that provide specific functionality.
Our project converted the LuaRocks codebase from Lua to
<a href="https://github.com/teal-language/tl">Teal</a>, a statically typed dialect of Lua,
to make the whole repository easier to read, understand, and improve.</p>

<p>The experience of working on a project with LabLua was amazing and
my mentor made it truly one of a kind.
I will never forget, not only the things I learned about Lua and Teal,
but also all the general tips I received about writing proper code, testing and deploying it, etc.
that I will for sure use in the future.
I would recommend this experience to everyone considering to apply!</p>
