<h2>Ideas List - Google Summer of Code 2021</h2>
<p> This year, we are applying to be a mentoring organization in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a>.
In this page we introduce some of the projects that are are working with us this year under the LabLua umbrella
and list some potential ideas for GSOC 2021 projects.

<p><strong>If you are a student interested in participating, it's still too early to apply.</strong>
</strong>However, it is never too early to get involved!</strong>
Feel free to get in touch with us via our <a href="mailto:labluagsoc@googlegroups.com">mailing list</a>
or one of the links below.

<h3 id="lldb">Lua scripted watchpoints in LLDB</h3>
<p> <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> is a modern debugger developed by the LLVM project.
LLDB can be scripted with Python and more recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgfzdAr9AFg&list=PL_R5A0lGi1ABzH_FIZSx0sHQkOqI7p4Cg&index=58">with Lua</a>.
<p> Scripted watchpoints allow users to attach a script or Lua function
to a watchpoint and execute it when the program flow hits it.
In this project, you will add support for Lua in scripted watchpoints.
You will also improve the general Lua scripting documentation.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Lua scripted watchpoints
    <li>Documentation for Lua scripting in LLDB

<h3 id="pallene-closures">Closures for Pallene</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a> is a statically-typed companion language for Lua.
It's main goal is improving Lua's performance by allowing programmers to use type annotations to write performant extension modules.

<p>The Pallene language implements a subset of Lua's features.
One feature that is currently missing are nested functions and closures.
Implementing them would empower programmers to use a more functional programming style and would make it easier to use Lua APIs that expect to receive a Pallene function as a callback.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Implement the required changes to the type checker and compiler
    <li>Document how nested functions work in Pallene
    <li>Unit tests for the new feature
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Some experience with compilers
    <li> Lua-C API
</ul>

<h4>Skill level</h4>
<p> Challenging
