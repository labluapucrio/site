<h1>Applying to Google Summer of Code at LabLua</h1>

<h2>The ideas list</h2>

<p>
Check out our <a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2016.html">ideas web page</a> or propose your own!
</p>

<h2>Getting in touch</h2>

<p>
You are encouraged to contact us before submitting your application. Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions. To introduce yourself, discuss ideas or your application, feel free to join us at our lab's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/labluagsoc">GSoC mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>
We are a programming language research lab at PUC-Rio, the university in Brazil where the <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> language is developed. We consist of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large. Our mentors will make sure to establish a friendly and respectful channel of communication with you.
</p>

<h2>Am I experienced enough?</h2>

<p>
Check out the difficulty level on each proposed project. All projects are designed to fit the length of GSoC, given the student's suitable level of experience: a project marked Easy may be taken by an early-stage undergraduate, while a project marked Hard might be more appropriate for a graduate student, or a particularly experienced undergraduate. We will take this into consideration when matching students to projects.
