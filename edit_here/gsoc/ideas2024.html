<h2>Ideas List - Google Summer of Code 2024</h2>
<p> We are proud to announce that this year we will again be participating in
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
In this page we introduce some of the projects that are are working with us this year under the LabLua umbrella
and list some potential ideas for GSOC 2024 projects.

<p>If you are a contributor candidate,
feel free to get in touch with us via our <a href="mailto:labluagsoc@googlegroups.com">mailing list</a>
or by sending an email to one of our mentors.
You can apply using one of the ideas in the list or you can bring your own idea.
Either way, don't leave it to the last minute :)

<p>Please use our <a href="/gsoc/apply2024.html">application template</a> to prepare your proposal.

<h3 id="lunatik-test">Port Lua Test Suite to Lunatik</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/">Lunatik</a> is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.
For example, Lunatik can be used for scripting the Linux networking subsystem
(as presented at Netdev
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x14/session.html?talk-linux-network-scripting-with-lua">0x14</a>
and
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/scripting-the-linux-routing-table-with-lua.html">0x17</a>)
among other
<a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#examples">examples</a>.

<p> The purpose of this project is to port the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/tests/">Lua Test Suite</a>
to Lunatik.
That is,
to adapt scripts from the Lua Test Suite and develop a Linux loadable kernel module containing its C portion.
This project might leverage the
<a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/blog2015.html#kerneltest">GSoC 2015 project</a>
developed by
<a href="mailto:gsz@acm.org">Guilherme Salazar</a>,
which ported the Lua Test Suite to the 
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/lua.4">NetBSD kernel</a>.

<p> The main difference between the kernel Lua and regular user-level Lua is
that kernel Lua doesn't have support for standard libraries that depend on operating system (e.g., io and os)
and for floating-point numbers.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Adapted test scripts for Lunatik
    <li> Lunatik library for testing the Lua C API
    <li> Test Report at least for x86_64 and ARM64
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (nice to have)
    <li> Experience with Linux kernel (nice to have)
</ul>

<h4>Skill level</h4>
<p> Intermediate

<h4>Project size</h4>
<p> Medium (175 hours)

<h4>Mentors</h4>

<h3 id="pallene-debugging">Improved debugging support for Pallene</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a>
is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua.
It is designed to to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types.

<p>Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the
type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.
The catch, is that Pallene can receive dynamically-typed data from Lua and it must check if this
data matches the expected types, before it can send it into the faster code paths.
If Pallene receives a value of an unexpected type, it will immediately raise an exception and
emit a stack trace. The objective of this project is to improve the debuggability of these stack traces.

<p> The biggest problem is that
currently the error message only shows the line number of the error.
The stack trace does not show the Pallene stack frames, only any Lua stack frames that might be present.
This is because, from Lua's point of view, Pallene stack calls are implemented as
C function calls and the default Lua stack traceback does not show C stack frames.
The main objective of this project would be to implement a way to include Pallene stack frames in the stack trace.

<p> One risk of the project is that the code needed to support stack traces
might potentially result in slower performance even when the code never encounters an error.
Therefore, an additional requirement is that we measure the performance of the new implementation.
If it is worse than before, it might be necessary to turn the improved stack traces into an optional
feature instead of the default.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A way to produce stack traces including all Pallene function calls
    <li>Benchmarks to measure the run-time overhead of supporting stack trace.
    <li>Document how the stack traces are implemented
    <li>Unit tests for the new feature
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (highly desirable)
    <li> Experience with Lua debuggers (nice to have)
</ul>

<h4>Skill level</h4>
<p> Challenging

<h4>Project size</h4>
<p> Large (350 hours)

<h3 id="lunatik-nefilter">Lunatik binding for Netfilter</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/">Lunatik</a> is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.
For example, Lunatik can be used for scripting the Linux networking subsystem
(as presented at Netdev
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x14/session.html?talk-linux-network-scripting-with-lua">0x14</a>
and
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/scripting-the-linux-routing-table-with-lua.html">0x17</a>)
among other
<a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#examples">examples</a>.

<p> Netfilter is a packet filtering framework provided by the Linux kernel.
It implements a set of hooks at well-defined points in the packet traversal of the network stack,
allowing registered callback functions to receive and act upon every packet that reaches their associated hooks.
The callback functions are defined by loadable kernel modules that dynamically extend Netfilter
in order to set up custom filtering strategies.

<p><a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/nflua">NFLua</a> is an extension module to Netfilter
which provides a kernel-scripting framework for packet filtering using an older version of the
Lunatik's Lua interpreter.
The purpose of this project is to create a new Lunatik library for binding Netfilter
to allow the creation of Netfilter extension modules in Lua
(instead of using Lua for scripting a single Netfilter module like NFLua).
This project should provide Lua APIs for hooking Netfilter
(similarly to <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#device">Lunatik device library</a>,
which allows the creation of character device drivers using Lua).

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lunatik Netfilter library
    <li> Iptables Lua library 
    <li> Benchmark comparison between NFLua and the Lunatik Netfilter library
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Linux Networking
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (highly desirable)
    <li> Experience with Linux kernel (highly desirable)
</ul>
