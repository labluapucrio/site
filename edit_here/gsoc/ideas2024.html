<h3 id="lunatik-test">Port Lua Test Suite to Lunatik</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/">Lunatik</a> is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.
For example, Lunatik can be used for scripting the Linux networking subsystem
(as presented at Netdev
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x14/session.html?talk-linux-network-scripting-with-lua">0x14</a>
and
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/scripting-the-linux-routing-table-with-lua.html">0x17</a>)
among other
<a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#examples">examples</a>.

<p> The purpose of this project is to port the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/tests/">Lua Test Suite</a>
to Lunatik.
That is,
to adapt scripts from the Lua Test Suite and develop a Linux loadable kernel module containing its C portion.
This project might leverage the
<a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/blog2015.html#kerneltest">GSoC 2015 project</a>
developed by
<a href="mailto:gsz@acm.org">Guilherme Salazar</a>,
which ported the Lua Test Suite to the 
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/lua.4">NetBSD kernel</a>.

<p> The main difference between the kernel Lua and regular user-level Lua is
that kernel Lua doesn't have support for standard libraries that depend on operating system (e.g., io and os)
and for floating-point numbers.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Adapted test scripts for Lunatik
    <li> Lunatik library for testing the Lua C API
    <li> Test Report at least for x86_64 and ARM64
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (nice to have)
    <li> Experience with Linux kernel (nice to have)
</ul>

<h4>Skill level</h4>
<p> Intermediate

<h4>Project size</h4>
<p> Medium (175 hours)

<h3 id="pallene-debugging">Improved debugging support for Pallene</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a>
is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua.
It is designed to to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types.

<p>Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the
type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.
The catch, is that Pallene can receive dynamically-typed data from Lua and it must check if this
data matches the expected types, before it can send it into the faster code paths.
If Pallene receives a value of an unexpected type, it will immediately raise an exception and
emit a stack trace. The objective of this project is to improve the debuggability of these stack traces.

<p> The biggest problem is that
currently the error message only shows the line number of the error.
The stack trace does not show the Pallene stack frames, only any Lua stack frames that might be present.
This is because, from Lua's point of view, Pallene stack calls are implemented as
C function calls and the default Lua stack traceback does not show C stack frames.
The main objective of this project would be to implement a way to include Pallene stack frames in the stack trace.

<p> One risk of the project is that the code needed to support stack traces
might potentially result in slower performance even when the code never encounters an error.
Therefore, an additional requirement is that we measure the performance of the new implementation.
If it is worse than before, it might be necessary to turn the improved stack traces into an optional
feature instead of the default.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A way to produce stack traces including all Pallene function calls
    <li>Benchmarks to measure the run-time overhead of supporting stack trace.
    <li>Document how the stack traces are implemented
    <li>Unit tests for the new feature
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (highly desirable)
    <li> Experience with Lua debuggers (nice to have)
</ul>

<h4>Skill level</h4>
<p> Challenging

<h4>Project size</h4>
<p> Large (350 hours)

<h3 id="lunatik-nefilter">Lunatik binding for Netfilter</h3>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/">Lunatik</a> is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.
For example, Lunatik can be used for scripting the Linux networking subsystem
(as presented at Netdev
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x14/session.html?talk-linux-network-scripting-with-lua">0x14</a>
and
<a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/scripting-the-linux-routing-table-with-lua.html">0x17</a>)
among other
<a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#examples">examples</a>.

<p> Netfilter is a packet filtering framework provided by the Linux kernel.
It implements a set of hooks at well-defined points in the packet traversal of the network stack,
allowing registered callback functions to receive and act upon every packet that reaches their associated hooks.
The callback functions are defined by loadable kernel modules that dynamically extend Netfilter
in order to set up custom filtering strategies.

<p><a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/nflua">NFLua</a> is an extension module to Netfilter
which provides a kernel-scripting framework for packet filtering using an older version of the
Lunatik's Lua interpreter.
The purpose of this project is to create a new Lunatik library for binding Netfilter
to allow the creation of Netfilter extension modules in Lua
(instead of using Lua for scripting a single Netfilter module like NFLua).
This project should provide Lua APIs for hooking Netfilter
(similarly to <a href="https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#device">Lunatik device library</a>,
which allows the creation of character device drivers using Lua).

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lunatik Netfilter library
    <li> Iptables Lua library 
    <li> Benchmark comparison between NFLua and the Lunatik Netfilter library
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Lua and C programming languages
    <li> Linux Networking
    <li> Experience with the Lua-C API (highly desirable)
    <li> Experience with Linux kernel (highly desirable)

<h3 id="teal-doc">Documentation generator tool for the Teal language</h3>
<p> The goal of this project is to create a "tealdoc" tool that generates documentation from comments embedded in
<a href="https://teal-language.org">Teal</a> source code. Teal is a statically typed language that compiles
to Lua (Teal is to Lua somewhat like TypeScript is to JavaScript). Since Teal is essentially a superset of Lua,
this tool should be useful for Lua as well. There is prior art for Lua (LuaDoc, LDoc),
but the community would benefit from a Teal-specific tool that is able to
make use of its type annotations as possibly integrate better with language servers in modern editors.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> a CLI tool that generates Markdown from Teal or Lua comments and Teal type annotations
    <li> support for generating HTML, possibly using templating systems (possibly reusing LDoc code)
    <li> stretch goal: integration with other existing tooling such as the vscode-teal plugin and LuaRocks
    <li> stretch goal: extensibility for supporting more languages in the Lua ecosystem
</ul>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://teal-language.org">Teal</a>
    <li> any Lua libraries needed
    <li><a href="https://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a>
</ul>

<h3 id="luarocks-teal">Port LuaRocks to Teal</h3>
<p><a href="https://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a> is the package manager for the Lua language.
It is written in pure Lua, making use of several optional libraries. The goal of this project is to port
the LuaRocks source code to <a href="https://teal-language.org">Teal</a>,
a statically typed language that compiles to Lua (Teal is to Lua somewhat like TypeScript is to JavaScript).

<p> Porting LuaRocks to Teal comprises essentially of writing type
annotations to its source code,
but will also allow for many opportunities for refactoring and
improving its codebase, understanding
and reporting on limitations of the Teal language and possibly inform
or contribute to its development.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> a version of LuaRocks written in Teal
</ul>

<h4>Tools</h4>

<h3 id="luarocks-windows">A Windows installer for LuaRocks</h3>
<p><a href="https://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a> is the package manager for the Lua language.
While the tool itself does have full Windows support, the installation process leaves much to be desired,
due to the lack of standard package management systems on Windows. The goal of this project is to
produce a native installer for LuaRocks on Windows using some FOSS GUI installer tool of your choice,
that allows installing LuaRocks, Lua and configuring it with the user's compiler toolchain.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
    <li> a GUI installer for LuaRocks
    <li> integration of the building of the GUI installer to the LuaRocks release scripts
(ideally it should be possible to cross-compile the installer generation on Linux, and/or run it from a CI system)
    <li> stretch goal: bundling the Mingw C compiler toolchain as an optional component of the installer
</ul>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a>
    <li> a FOSS GUI installer toolkit, such as <a href="WIX">https://wixtoolset.org</a> or <a href="NSIS">https://nsis.sf.net</a>
    <li> Microsoft Windows
</ul>
