<h3 id="iot"> Google Cloud IoT Core Interface in Lua</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<b>Cloud IoT Core</b> is a fully managed service that allows to easily and 
securely connect, manage, and ingest data from millions of globally dispersed 
devices. 
<p>
Cloud IoT Core, in combination with other services on Google Cloud IoT platform,
provides a complete solution for collecting, processing, analyzing, and 
visualizing IoT data in real time to support improved operational efficiency.
<p>
The interface with Cloud IoT Core is through APIs, with examples in the 
following programming languages: C#, Go, Java, NODE.JS, PHP, Python, Ruby.
<p>
<b>Android Things</b> allows Android developers to create solutions for IoT, 
from prototype to production quickly.

<h4>The Project</h4>

<a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is considered one of the most suitable 
programming languages for use in the area of IoT - Internet of Things. 
This <a href="https://vimeo.com/292779036">video</a> produced by ACM presents
the main information on Lua and its possible use in IoT.
<p>
The project consists of developing an interface, in Lua, for the set of Cloud
IoT Core APIs, through two REST resources:
<ul>
<li>cloudiot methods, to facilitate device manager tasks
<li>cloudiotdevice methods, to facilitate device communication over the HTTP 
bridge
</ul>

In addition, the project aims to offer a library of functions that will allow
the development of applications for IoT in development environments that use
Lua, such as Love 2D and Corona platforms, similarly as in Android Things.
<p>

<h4>Tools</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The language <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> will be used in the project
</li>
<li>
Information about IoT-targeted services offered by Google can be accessed on 
the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/">Cloud IoT Core pages</a>
<li>
Frameworks application development in Lua, such as 
<a href="https://love2d.org/">Love 2D</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/">Corona</a>
<li>
A list of IoT devices, low cost and simple to operate, will be provided for the tests to be performed
</ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>
We expect the student to have a heavy knowledge about Lua 
(including the Lua/C interface) and an intermediate knowledge 
about the area of IoT- internet of things and the use of REST interface with web-based systems
<p>
We ask applicants to complete the following activities before the 
application period:
<ul>
<li>Sign up for a free trial on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google
Cloud Platform</a>
<li>Study the features and set of APIs offered by Google Cloud IoT
<li>Accomplish some testing with a device for IoT, using one of the indicated 
devices in the list to be provided and one of the suggested development 
frameworks
</ul>
